## Media Settings

Once media have been uploaded, you are able to control several of its properties through the asset's details:

* **Asset Details** | Here you can add an expandable description and a clickable link to an external url.
* **Transform Properties** | Here you can control the asset's position, rotation, and scale.
* **Frame** | For 2D media, such as images or external website links, you can add a colored frame to give your media extra dimensionality.
* **Playback Settings** | For media with some form of playback, such as videos or streams, you can control audio and playback settings.
