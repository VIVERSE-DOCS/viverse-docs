# Introduction to Developer Tools

***

## How Developers Use Our Tools

Our goal is to make it simple to publish rich experiences to VIVERSE. These tools help our creator community build more advanced 3D experiences, including multiplayer games, and utilize the account and avatar system to give users a more seamless experience when hopping from world to world in VIVERSE.

While we do not require developers use these tools — and while we also make it possible for developers to include their own servers/databases/external APIs in VIVERSE projects — we highly recommend that all creators familiarize themselves with these offerings and consider integrating the VIVERSE account & avatar system into their projects. It makes the experience better for our users and many of these services are available for free!

## Provisioning Your Own Game Servers & Services

While the above services are available for free to our developers to use, we frequently allow developers to include their own, externally hosted services in their VIVERSE creations. If you have an API endpoint, database, or hosted gameserver that you would like to access in VIVERSE, please email michael\_morran@htc.com and james\_kane@htc.com OR join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/viversecreators) and message us with more information about the nature of your service and the URL you would like whitelisted!
