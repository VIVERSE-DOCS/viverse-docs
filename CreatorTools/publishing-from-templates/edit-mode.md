# Edit Mode

***

## Getting Started with Edit Mode

Edit Mode is available on all worlds you own or where you have been added as a co-owner/moderator.  If you are a world owner or co-owner, you will have access to the "Edit Mode" button when you join the world.

When enabling Edit Mode, your controls and interface will be changed, and your camera will be detached from your avatar so that you can more easily navigate and edit your world. When in Edit Mode, your avatar will still be visible and your audio will be audible to others in the world.

The Edit Mode interface has three sections, the performance report in the top-left corner, the media upload toolbar in the bottom of your screen, and the object list in the top right where you can access and control the settings of all media added to your world in Edit Mode.

## Adding and Handling Media

Media can be added from several different sources through the toolbar in the bottom of the Edit Mode interface: Sketchfab, Marketplace assets, uploaded assets, and assets linked from external sources. For more information on the types of media you can add and their settings, see [this page](supported-media-and-settings.md).

When media are added to your world, you can access and update their properties through the object list on the right-hand side of the Edit Mode interface. Furthermore, you can quickly reposition your media by clicking and dragging them through your world.

## Adding Collaborators

You can add five additional VIVERSE accounts as co-owners of your world. By promoting these users, you are giving them full control over Edit Mode, moderation tools, and world settings for your world. Co-owners can be removed and will not be able to delete the world on your behalf. Co-owners can be added outside of Edit Mode by going to the hamburger settings button in the top-right of your world, selecting the "Permissions" tab, and adding Co-Owners by their user id or display name.
