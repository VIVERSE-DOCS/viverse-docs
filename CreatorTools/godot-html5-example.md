# Godot HTML5 Example

***

## Introduction

In this getting-started guide, we will cover the basics of setting up a [Godot HTML5](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html) project and publishing to VIVERSE using [the VIVERSE CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@viverse/cli).

## A. Project Settings for Godot

Web support for Godot currently requires the engine version to be Godot 4.1 or higher for successful exports. **Currently using Godot without C# is essential**. However, web export support for C# is expected soon from a recent [announcement](https://godotengine.org/article/live-from-godotcon-boston-web-dotnet-prototype/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Godot 3 web exports are technically supported but not focused on future support.
{% endhint %}

## B. Export Setting for Godot

Select the desired platform for export. For web exporting, choose `HTML5`. Also **make sure that the export path is set to Build/index.html**. This will lower your packaged build size and rename project exported .html to index.html so VIVERSE can easily find and run the project.&#x20;

## C. Publish to VIVERSE

From here you can publish the project using the CLI tool just like any other platform.&#x20;
