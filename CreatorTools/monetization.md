## Earning on VIVERSE

We are proud to support developers and teams of all sizes and artistic backgrounds on VIVERSE. In addition to investing in the development of new content on VIVERSE through our [Creator Program](https://create.viverse.com/creator-program), we are excited to offer a number of ways for creators to earn on VIVERSE.&#x20;

We are currently working to explore and release these tools to our developers. Here are some of the monetization methods that are/will be available to creators...
