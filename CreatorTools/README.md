## The Best on the Web

{% columns %}
{% column valign="middle" %}
VIVERSE is home to the **best content on the internet** that can be shared with audiences around the world through the **web browser**. Whether you are building engaging 3D experiences, web applications, or videos, your work can easily be hosted on and shared through VIVERSE. Our goal is to help creators distribute and monetize their work through VIVERSE's easy hosting and content distribution.

## Publishing to VIVERSE

Creators can host web-compatible content of all kinds on VIVERSE using [Studio](publishing-with-your-viverse-account.md), the one-stop-shop for managing content on VIVERSE. Through Studio, creators can upload new experiences, apps, and videos, and monitor the performance of content already on VIVERSE. In addition to Studio, we also offer a [Command Line Interface](standalone-app-publishing/publishing-to-viverse-with-the-cli.md) for creators uploading 3D experiences and applications to publish from the terminal (and even [integrate publishing to VIVERSE directly into their tools](https://news.viverse.com/post/wonderland-engine-viverse-integration)).

**Engaging 3D experiences are the bread and butter of VIVERSE.** As part of [HTC](https://www.htc.com/us/), the VIVERSE team has a rich legacy of empowering creators building in 3D and XR. As such, we have implemented several tools to help creators building 3D experiences.

## Sharing Content

VIVERSE makes it easy for creators to share  work with audiences both on and outside of VIVERSE. After uploading their creations to VIVERSE, creators may select from multiple visibility levels, participate in content curation and discovery, and embed their VIVERSE-hosted content on any webpage of their choosing.

## Monetization

At VIVERSE, our goal is not only to help creators share their work, but also to **help creators earn from their creations**! We offer a variety of tools for creators to earn on VIVERSE, including engagement-based compensation, channel subscriptions, paid titles, and in-app purchases. Additionally, we frequently host competitions and programs where creators can participate and receive rewards and funding for building with VIVERSE.

## Optimization

The web browser is the most accessible platform for content sharing across the internet. Billions of devices, from mobile phones, to desktop computers, and VR headsets, have access to the browser! However, with so many potential users and devices, it is important to ensure that your content performs well for all of your intended users. Even if you do not have experience building for the web browser, we are here to help creators bring their work to the web for the first time!
