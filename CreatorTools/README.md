# Introduction to Creator Tools

***

## What are the Creator Tools?

VIVERSE includes a robust series of tools for artists and developers to build engaging 3D experiences. These tools are sorted into two main categories:

* Integrations with development platforms, such as PlayCanvas and Unity, that allow creators to **publish directly to VIVERSE.**
* **Developer tools and SDKs**, such as Polygon Streaming, which can either be used in creations published to VIVERSE or hosted elsewhere.

## Tools for Publishing to VIVERSE

VIVERSE is a web-based platform for 3D content where creators can showcase their work to the VIVERSE user-base and monetize. Our goal is to help you publish from the platform that works best for you and leverage your chosen tools. Whether you are hosting a meetup, creating an engaging narrative, or building a full length multiplayer game, there are several options for you to publish your work on VIVERSE.

<table><thead><tr><th>Platform</th><th width="386">Description</th><th>Documentation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Create from Templates</td><td>Create from our library of world templates and add 3D elements and media directly in VIVERSE. World decoration is great for meetup hosts and beginners looking to customize their first world from a wide range of template environments.</td><td><a href="publishing-from-templates/edit-mode.md">See here</a></td></tr><tr><td>Standalone Publishing</td><td>Developers may publish to VIVERSE using any platform that can build for WebGL/HTML5. Publish from UnityWebGL, Godot, ThreeJS, Babylon, AFRAME, and more!</td><td><a href="broken-reference">See here</a></td></tr><tr><td>PlayCanvas</td><td>PlayCanvas is an open source game engine with a web-based editor.

## Standalone Developer Tools

Along with our platform integrations that allow you to publish to VIVERSE, we also have a number of standalone developer tools that can be utilized in experiences hosted on _and_ off of VIVERSE. These tools help creators get the most out of their 3D experience and make the difficult parts of online development easier.
