# Publishing with Your VIVERSE Account

***

## VIVERSE Account

All creations published to your VIVERSE account are known as "Worlds" and can be accessed on the "My Worlds" tab of the account page. Here, you can also see any creators that you are following or worlds that you have favorited.

Currently, Worlds can only be associated with, owned and managed by one VIVERSE account. The owner's account name will display under the world on the VIVERSE world discovery page.

## Scene vs World URLs

When publishing to VIVERSE, creations will be given a **single-player Scene URL** and a **multi-player World URL.**&#x20;

The Scene URL, such as https://create.viverse.com/scenes/1234567, is designed as a preview for creators to quickly iterate on their project's visuals and mechanics without worrying about networked gameplay. The Scene URL can be shared and accessed by anyone with access to the URL, however you will not be able to see or hear other networked avatars.

The World URL, such as https://create.viverse.com/aBCdEfG, is the fully published, multiplayer environment that may be made discoverable by other VIVERSE users on the world discovery page. The World URL's accessibility is determined by the World's settings. Here you will be able to see and hear other networked avatars who have access to the World URL

## World Settings

A world's settings can be edited by clicking the kebab menu next to your world on your account page.

With the world settings, you can configure your world's name, description, thumbnail, and accessibility settings. Both Genre and Access will influence how your world is categorized and displayed on the VIVERSE world discovery page.

Worlds can be set to one of three accessibility states and can be password protected to add an additional level of security.

## Discovery and Metrics

Worlds that are made "Public" are discoverable on the VIVERSE world discovery page. Worlds are categorized automatically by genre settings and device compatibility (corresponding to file size and optimization level), as well as manually by the VIVERSE curation team.

On the world discovery page, worlds can also be sorted by unique viewer count, likes, and creation time. At this time, these are the only metrics available for creators.
