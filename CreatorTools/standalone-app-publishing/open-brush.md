### Introduction

In December 2025, VIVERSE and the Icosa Foundation, Open Brush's steward, teamed up with digital artist SUTU to create a publishing pipeline for Open Brush creators to host, distribute, and monetize their work on VIVERSE. When publishing to VIVERSE, creators are able to share their work on Mobile, Desktop, and VR through the web browser, complete with networked VRM avatars and real-time chat. The publishing process is a simple and powerful way for Open Brush creators to expand their audiences and make their work more accessible!

### Publishing Tutorial

### Tips & Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>What should I do after publishing?</summary>

After publishing, we encourage all creators to curate their [world settings](../publishing-with-your-viverse-account.md#world-settings) and [creator profile](../publishing-with-your-viverse-account.md#profile-settings). These help with discoverability on VIVERSE.&#x20;

We also encourage creators to take advantage of the easy sharing of your work on VIVERSE. You can quickly share your VIVERSE url with anyone and even embed it on your artistic website. If you post your world, tag @VIVERSEOfficial on all platforms and we will help share!
